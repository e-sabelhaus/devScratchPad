devScratchPad
=============

This is where my development code will live as a backup, and for other folks to check out my code for reference

Over the next few years, as I venture through college level courses in Comp Science, and as I adventure into new software, I will be posting the files i create to this repo. I don't intend on building anything from the repo, or releasing any product for use.

Simply put, I am going to post finished work that compiles correctly and executes as designed.

Feel free to send me a message if you have questions about any of the code that I post, send it to 
eric.sabelhaus@gmail.com

Thanks
